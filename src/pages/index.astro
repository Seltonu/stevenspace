        This website is a work in progress!<br>I plan to post devblogs about my projects and cool things I'm learning :)
        (Still working on supporting other screen sizes. View on desktop!)

        This little corner of the internet is my safe space.
        I've been doing a lot of writing lately so I might post some. Here be dragons, but I wont get too personal.

        This isn't intended to be a resume site at the moment. Just a place for me to document myself that isn't
        tied to a social media algorithm.
